NuFridge
========


NuFridge is a web application for managing your internal NuGet feeds.

You can use NuFridge to quickly create new NuGet Feeds, or Delete old feeds.

NuFridge is useful for oganisations that require more than one internal NuGet feed.

The NuGet feeds that are created are Klondike based feeds: https://github.com/themotleyfool/Klondike which means they use Lucene indexing for lightning fast performance.

We shall be extending NuFridge with additional optional capabilities, such as Octopus Deploy integration.
