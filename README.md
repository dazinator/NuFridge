NuFridge
========


NuFridge is a web application for managing your NuGet feeds.

You can use NuFridge to quickly create new NuGet Feeds, or Delete old feeds.

NuFridge also has additional functionality such as Retention Policies - so you can easily create policies to control the packages that you retain on your feeds.

NuFridge is useful for anyone that wants to easily be able to get started with creating and managing NuGet feeds.

The NuGet feeds that are created are Klondike based feeds: https://github.com/themotleyfool/Klondike which means they use Lucene indexing for lightning fast performance - better than using the NuGet standard implementation alone.

We shall be extending NuFridge with additional optional capabilities, such as Octopus Deploy integration, and other cool things.
